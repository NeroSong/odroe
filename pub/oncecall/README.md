# Oncecall

Oncecall is a lightweight Flutter package that provides a simple and efficient way to memoize function calls within a build context. It helps optimize performance by ensuring that expensive computations are only performed once per build cycle.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Efficient Memoization: Caches function results to avoid redundant computations
- ðŸ”„ Context-Aware: Automatically resets cache on rebuild
- ðŸŽ¯ Easy to Use: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter widgets
- ðŸ›  Flexible: Works with any type of function and return value

## Getting started

Add `oncecall` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  oncecall: ^0.0.1
```

Then, import the package in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:oncecall/oncecall.dart';
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use Oncecall:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:oncecall/oncecall.dart';

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final expensiveResult = oncecall(context, () {
      // Expensive computation here
      return someExpensiveFunction();
    });

    return Text('Result: $expensiveResult');
  }
}
```
